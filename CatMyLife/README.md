# CatMyLife at PennApps

CatMyLife is an efficiency app made for Android Platforms (Android Lolipop 5.0+) using google fit API.

## What?
An app that makes you to keep an active lifestyle, be productive in your study and work and maintain a healthy sleep schedule with the fun company of a cute cat.

## Why?
Cat is a creature that everyone loves. We all need a little extra motive to put the phone down to exercise, study and get proper rest. What's more inspiriting than taking care of your little kitty and keep her fit, smart and vibrant!

## How?
You will be able to adopt a cat and customize a lovely name for her when you first open the app. 
Becoming a master, you will need to take responsibility to earn coins by walking. The coins will be used to buy food for your adorable cat. 
When you study, she will be reading her own books and be waiting for you (she doesn't like to be disturbed!) This way, she will grow smarter and makes you proud!
And when she's tired, you need to accompany her to get enough sleep so that she can be healthy and vibrant!
Together, the kitty will help you develop a wholesome lifestyle and become your best friend ;)

## Future developments
We are planning to add more features such as sleep quality tracking, social network integration, achievement board, statistic visulization of your performance and so on... It's going to be fun!
